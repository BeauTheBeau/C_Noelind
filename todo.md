- [X] Way for lekars to heal others
    - [X] If members are below a certain HP amount, when they try to eat, they will not be able to heal. 
    - [X] Instead, they will receive a message telling them they must visit the Lekar (our version of a healer). 
    - [X] Lekars will be able to perform a heal command.
      - [X] I don't want that heal command to restore ALL their xp though, 
      - [X] maybe like 75% or some percentage that you think makes sense. 
    - [X] Members need to receive a message telling them if to heal was successful and what their new HP is.
